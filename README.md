A media library built with React + Redux + Redux-Sagas

I used Yahoo's Flickr API + ShutterStock's API for pictures & videos

This App is hosted on Heroku. Links and updates can be accessed through my portfolio at: http://mvholman.com/

Features To Add
*Add tests for your application.
*Add error handling functionality.
*Add a loading spinner for API calls for good user experience.
*Add sharing functionality to allow users share on their social media walls
*Allow users to like an image.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
