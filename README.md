A media library built with React + Redux + Redux-Sagas

I used Yahoo's Flickr API + ShutterStock's API for pictures & videos

This App is hosted on Heroku. Links and updates can be accessed through my portfolio at: http://mvholman.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
